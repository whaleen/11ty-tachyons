# 11ty + TACHYONS

## Quickly begin prototyping using 11ty and Tachyons.

Get started by deploying **11ty+Tachyons** to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons)

See the [demo](https://11ty-tachyons.netlify.com) of a Netlify deploy.

### Clone and develop locally

If you have deployed to Netlify, note any change to the repository name you may have made as the following command will need to be changed to match.

```git clone https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons my-site-name```

```cd my-site-name```

```npm install```

```npm start```


### Note to Jekyll users:

This template may be an ideal introduction to 11ty for you. It is structured in a manner that is similar to a Jekyll project. I recommend you to read [this article](https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/) to get up to speed.


### Make It Your Own

1. Edit ```/_data/site.json``` which contains things such as the site name, author, Google Analytics ID, etc...
2. Go wild with Tachyons

### Tachyons

A Saas distribution of Tachyons can be found in ```/scss/```. Additional CSS can be written in ```/scss/custom.scss```
